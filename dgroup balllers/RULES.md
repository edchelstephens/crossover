Good evening mga bro,

As mentioned, we only have a maximum of 30 players per Saturday's Gameday.

This is the max number we can accomodate to have the maximum enjoyment/fun for all participating players. 
Para walay makulangan ug dula and sakto ra ang rest/puli2x in between games.

Since 1st come 1st serve man ta sa list,
To be fair sa tanan, we will implement the following:

# On a given Saturday Gameday:

1. The cut-off time for the listing is every Sat @ 1pm.
If on the day, dli ka ka.dayun, please clear your name sa list before 1pm, 
kay usually naa pana mga gusto mu.apas, na.hutdan lang ug slot sa lista kay na.ulahi.

2. If a player who is listed on that day was not able to attend the game.
Then on the next Saturday, he will be put on a non-priority pool*

3. If a player who is not listed on that day came and attended the game.
Then, he will be put on a non-priority pool* that day.

* What is a non-priorty pool? 

If a player is on the non-priority pool, 
then, everytime it is his turn to be part of game, 
he will be moved to the next game instead.

4. The players who are listed and was able to come and attend the games will be the priority for the game set of players.
The goal is that everyone will have the same amount of games played.
But since there will be early/late people, then this would vary.
Early players will be prioritized if same2x na ang number of games played sa mga players
